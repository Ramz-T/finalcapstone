## Project Overview

The Simple Cypher project aims to encrypt and decrypt text using a simple substitution cypher algorithm. The algorithm replaces each letter in the text with a different letter from the alphabet, providing a basic level of encryption. This project serves as a learning exercise and introduction to the concept of encryption.

## Repository Structure

The repository consists of the following files:

- `cypher.py`: This file contains the source code for the Simple Cypher program.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for running or setting up the project.

## Usage

To use the Simple Cypher program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Ramz-T/finalcapstone.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd finalcapstone
   ```

3. Open the `cypher.py` file in a text editor.

4. Modify the `text` variable with the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.

5. Run the program by executing the `cypher.py` file:

   ```
   python cypher.py
   ```

6. The program will output the encrypted or decrypted text based on the provided algorithm.

7. Experiment with different texts and algorithms by modifying the code in the `cypher.py` file.
